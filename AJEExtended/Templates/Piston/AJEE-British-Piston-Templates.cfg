		description = The Centaurus is an 18-cylinder, two-row design that eventually delivered over 3,000 hp (2,200 kW). The engine was introduced into service late in the Second World War and was one of the most powerful aircraft piston engines to see service. It powered aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest, Bristol Brabazon and Hawker Sea Fury.
